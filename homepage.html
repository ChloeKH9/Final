     <p> Welcome to my site! This website will take you through multiple python codes all relating to the world of broadway</p>
</div> 
<h1> • Instructions/ Overview </h1>
<p>My project focuses on different data about Broadway that I’ve compiled such as prices of tickets and audiences. It was surprisingly easy to find a lot of information so it came down to how I would apply it. Through a bunch of different codes, I focused on different things we’ve learned throughout the semester. Go through each page to learn more.</p>
<h1> • Bugs and errors </h1>
<p>The Years and Attendance lists print with duplicates, although currently I don’t have it printing out in my code </p>
<p>The codes that require input don’t have systems to correct errors </p>
